# 🛠️ Agriculture Supply Chain Transparency with Hyperledger Fabric

## 🌐 Objective
In traditional supply chain models, information about an entity is often not fully transparent, leading to inaccurate reports and a lack of interoperability. Emails and printed documents can provide limited information but fail to offer complete visibility and traceability. This makes it difficult for consumers to know the true value of the products they purchase. 

Blockchain technology offers a transparent, immutable, and secure decentralized system that can revolutionize traditional supply chain industries by improving the following areas:

- 📦 **Tracking**: Monitor products throughout the entire supply chain.
- ✅ **Verifying & Authenticating**: Ensure the authenticity of products.
- 🔗 **Information Sharing**: Enable seamless sharing of chain information among supply chain actors.
- 📊 **Auditability**: Enhance the audit process for better compliance and reporting.

## 🌱 Use Cases
- **Farm to Fork Tracking**: Ensuring transparency from agricultural production to consumer purchase.


## 🛠️ Components Developed
- **Frontend**: React.js application for user interaction and visualization.
- **Network**: Hyperledger Fabric to manage the blockchain infrastructure.
- **Chaincode**: Javascript for writing the smart contracts.

## 👥 Users in this Application
- **Manufacturer**: Responsible for producing goods.
- **Wholesaler**: Handles bulk purchasing and distribution.
- **Distributer**: Distributes products to markets.
- **Market**: The end-user of the product.
